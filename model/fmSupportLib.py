# in order to add an additional FM demodulator without the arctan function,
# a very good and to-the-point description is given by Richard Lyons at:
#
# https://www.embedded.com/dsp-tricks-frequency-demodulation-algorithms/
#
# the demodulator boils down to implementing equation (13-117) from above, where
# the derivatives are nothing else but differences between consecutive samples
#
# needless to say, you should not jump directly to equation (13-117)
# rather try first to understand the entire thought process based on calculus
# identities, like derivative of the arctan function or derivatives of ratios
